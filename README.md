# cornell-notes-generator

A simple Cornell notes generator with Latex.

After learning how to take the best notes, I create this.

Tested with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (the reason was: [Choosing a LaTeX Compiler](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Choosing_a_LaTeX_Compiler))

Use portrait or landscape view in letter or A4 size, choose the format seeing the end of the code.
